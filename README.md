## Data set
- Employee Salaries - 2024
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/employee-salaries-2024

## Problem Description
- The dataset titled ‚ÄúEmployee Salaries - 2024‚Äù contains detailed information about employee compensation across various departments and divisions. It includes a total of 10,398 rows and 8 columns, each representing a different attribute related to employee salary data. The data was obtained from the US Government Database The columns in the dataset are as follows: Department, which provides the abbreviated name of the department; Department Name, which gives the full name of the department; and Division, which refers to specific teams or units within each department. The Gender column identifies whether the employee is male (M) or female (F). Salary-related information includes Base Salary, which is a float data type representing the employee's annual base pay , 2024 Overtime Pay for any additional earnings from extra hours worked, and 2024 Longevity Pay, which accounts for bonus payments based on years of service. Lastly, the Grade column indicates the employee‚Äôs job level or classification (such as M3, EX2, or N17), although this field contains some missing values. Overall, this dataset provides a comprehensive snapshot of employee compensation, allowing for in-depth analysis of salary structures, gender pay comparisons, and departmental compensation trends.



## Question 1
Question 2: Which departments have the highest average total compensation (base + longevity + overtime), and how does it differ by gender?

- This shows you which departments may have pay gaps or higher overall compensation levels across genders
- Total compensation was calculated by the following: (base + longevity + overtime)
- We calculated the total compensation because it shows the complete amount of money an employee earns, not just their base salary. This helps give a full picture of employee earnings, which helps when comparing compensation across departments and identifying pay disparities
- This analysis reveals which departments offer the highest overall compensation when combining base salary, longevity pay, and overtime pay. Breaking down the results by gender also highlights potential pay disparities between men and women within the same department. This helps identify departments with the most competitive pay structures and uncovers any possible gender-based inequalities in total compensation


## Question 2
Question 3: Are males or females receiving more longevity or overtime pay in the Department of Health and Housing, Department of Technology and Enterprise Business Solutions, Office of Public Relations, and Office of Public Relations?

- Average Overtime Pay Summary:
The top visualization highlights differences in average overtime pay across departments, with a focus on gender disparities. In the Department of Health and Human Resources, both male and female employees received similar overtime compensation, averaging around $880. However, a large gap is seen in the Department of Technology and Enterprise Business Solutions, where females earned significantly less overtime than males, only $135, compared to much higher male figures. The Office of Human Resources recorded no overtime pay for either gender. In the Office of Public Information, the gender gap is especially prominent, with males earning an average of $1,240 in overtime pay, while females received just $32. These results suggest inequality in overtime compensation across some departments.

- Average Total Compensation Summary:
The bottom chart compares average total compensation, including longevity pay, by gender across different departments. The Department of Technology and Enterprise Business Solutions shows relatively equal compensation between males and females, both averaging around $1,574. In contrast, the Department of Health and Human Resources and the Office of Human Resources show moderate compensation levels with small gender differences, at $1,329 and $778, respectively. The most extreme disparity is in the Office of Public Information, where males earned a standard amount while females received no compensation. This suggests a broader issue with pay equity that may need to be addressed in specific departments.
